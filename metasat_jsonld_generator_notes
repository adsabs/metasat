what groupings make the most sense for presenting the metasat generator?

pop open and close sections?

let the users rearrange the sections...?

add/remove their own fields?


Allie has pointed out, rightfully, that javascript is often disabled on phones and some other browsers.  so how much do we want to rely on javascript for the above fancy stuff?
javascript and nonjavascript version?

validation?

scope of our generator wrt other schemas?

include common schema.org elements
"supported schema.org elements"

other external vocabs?
maybe allow users to add their own fav schemas?  save to browser?
incorporate API calls for other schemas?
