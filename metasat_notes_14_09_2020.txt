general mission form to start with

not have pre-defined forms

many starting users might want a basic suggested sturcture

can we output from the sorting tool?

general suggested sections, like families/segments

how to present nesting suggestions?

cannot generalize subsystems, users, or ground... launch is too bare bones
-- a lot dont have propuslion, which affects how electrical and atitude control is organized, elements get moved around to different subsystems depending on the type of mission
-- what about subsystems names would change? i still dont understand this

high level mission or observation can be generalized


intended audience and knowledge level? how familyt with metasat before they use the tool?
-- someone interested in doing better documentation of the mission
-- best use case is after the fac,t i knoow what we did and making a record after the fact, a form to fill out so i know i described it right
-- but the user shouldnt have to know a whole lot about metsat, the strcture, all the ins and outs

suggest elements associated with other elements


are there pieces of metasat that you CAN recommend a hierarchy? like even just little pieces?

term sets, blank examples


so..how are we not making a decision tree???
ok we ARE making a decision tree, well my version of one XD


proof of concept, generating jsonLD progreamatically, the PICARD mission
